**1. Hypotheses</br>**

- Hypothesis 1: Higher income leads to an increase in bicycle purchase rates.</br>
- Hypothesis 2: Individuals without children are more likely to purchase bicycles.</br>

</br>

**2. Analysis Process</br>**

- Data cleaning: Identifying and removing missing values and outliers.</br>
- Analyzing the relationship between income and bicycle purchase (mean comparison and visualization).</br>
- Examining the correlation between the number of children and bicycle purchase (Chi-square test).</br>
- Conducting multivariate analysis considering additional factors (age, education level, etc.).</br>
</br>

**3. Key Findings**</br>

- Income and Bicycle Purchase Rate:</br>
The average income of customers who purchased a bicycle was approximately $50,000, while those who did not purchase had an average income of $40,000.</br>
However, for income levels above $60,000, the increase in bicycle purchase rates slowed down.</br>
</br>

- Number of Children and Purchase Rate:</br>
Customers without children had the highest bicycle purchase rate at 35%, while purchase rates decreased as the number of children increased.
Particularly, customers with three or more children had a purchase rate of less than 20%.</br>
</br>

- Additional Factor Analysis:</br>
The highest bicycle purchase rate was observed in the 31-54 age group, while it declined significantly among those 55 and older.</br>
In terms of commuting distance, customers with a commute of '2-5 miles' showed the highest purchase rate.</br>
Gender analysis revealed that males had a higher bicycle purchase rate than females (approximately 60% vs. 40%).</br>
</br>

**4. Conclusion</br>**
Income and the number of children were significant factors influencing bicycle purchase decisions. Additionally, age and occupation also played an important role. Furthermore, commuting distance and gender were found to impact purchasing patterns.</br>
